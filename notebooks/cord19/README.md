# CORD-19 search app
The team behind [vespa.ai](https://vespa.ai/) has built and open-sourced a
[CORD-19 search engine](https://cord19.vespa.ai/).
Thanks to advanced Vespa features such as
[Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search](https://blog.vespa.ai/approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-in-vespa-part-1/)
and [Transformers support via ONNX](https://blog.vespa.ai/introducing-nlp-with-transformers-on-vespa/)
it comes with the most advanced NLP methodology applied to search that is currently available.

In this tutorial we illustrate how to evaluate and improve this application.
